## Story

Solarized was meticulously designed by Ethan Schoonover. The colors are mathematically analyzed and the contrast is easy on my eyes. But the greens did not match the rest of most OS. The dark green/blue is from Ethan's fear of deep bodies of water (Thalassophobia).

Atom One Dark stemmed from the once popular Atom text editor by Github. A perfectly neutral theme it solves light bleeding in LCD monitors while making the text readable. Even though it was a beautiful theme, it did not match the mathmatical riguros of Solarized Dark.

Solarized One is a blend of neutral beauty of Atom One with the structure of Solarized Dark. The design removes any personal bias to match most operating systems. The dark greenb/blues are replaced with Atom One's grey while respecting the rest of the Solarized theme.
